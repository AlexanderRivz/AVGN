Animal Vocalization Generative Network (AVGN)
==============================

This is a project for taking animal vocalization audio recordings, and learning a generative model of segments of those vocalizations (e.g. syllables) using modern machine learning techniques. Specifically. This package will take in a dataset of wav files, segment them into units (e.g. syllables of birdsong) and train a generative model on those segments. The learned latent representations can be used to cluster syllables in an unsupervised manner, generate novel syllables, visualize sequences, or perform several other analyses.
